        Steve Jobs was a co-founder and longtime chief executive officer at
        Apple. On June 12, 2005, Steve gave the commencement address at Stanford
        University.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his address Steve urged graduates to follow their dreams and, despite
        any setbacks, to never give up&ndash;advice which he sincerely took to
        heart.

      <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
      <p>
        Headings are often followed by supporting paragraphs. Paragraphs are
        defined using the
      </p>
      <p>
        block-level element. Paragraphs can appear one after the other, adding
        information to a page as desired. Here is an example of how to set up
        paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make text bold and place a strong importance on it, we'll use the
        |strong| inline-level element. There are two elements that will bold
        text for us: the |strong| and |b| elements. It is important to
        understand the semantic difference between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        The |strong| element is semantically used to give strong importance to
        text, and is thus the most popular option for bolding text. The |b|
        element, on the other hand, semantically means to stylistically offset
        text, which isn't always the best choice for text deserving prominent
        attention. We have to gauge the significance of the text we wish to set
        as bold and to choose an element accordingly.
